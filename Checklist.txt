DC:
Read the shared memory's circular buffer
Buffer holds 265 characters (Value A -> T)
Check for existance of shared memory
if doesn't exist, sleep for 10 seconds and try again
DC is launched by the CP-2 application
DP-2 will pass the DP-1 processID and DP-2 processID on the command line
Read the letters using the reading index
Track the number of letters that it reads out of the buffer
Wake up every 2 seconds (using SIGALARM) and read the buffer
Prevent reading past the end
Wrap back to the start once it hits the end
every 10 seconds display a histogram of counts
ones (-), tens(+), hundreds(*) (i.e. *+++-- = 132)
If the DC recieves the SIGINIT, it will send it to its producers
Read all data from the buffer, clear the screen, exit with "Shazam !!" string


DP:

ONLY DP-1: 
Allocate shared memory for 256 characters and 2 read/write indicies
check for existance of shared memory, if not there create it
Launch DP-2, and only pass the sharedMemoryID

ONLY DP-2:
DP-2 needs to get the PID of itself and DP-1 (its parent) to launch the DC
Launch DC THEN attach to the shared memory

ALL:
guard the writing to the memory through a semaphore
DP-1 generate 20 random letters at one time
DP-2 generate one random letter and sleep for 1/20th of a second
listen for and handle the SIGINIT signal, immediately exiting once received
wrap writes back to the zero index after 255
if DP is slow, sleep and wait for it to catch up
